# TypeScript OOP Learning Guide

A comprehensive guide to learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript, complete with detailed notes and hands-on exercises.

## 📚 What's Included

This repository contains everything you need to master TypeScript OOP concepts:

### Study Notes (10 Topics + Reference)

All documentation is organized in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:

0. [**Real-World Use Cases**](docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md) - Understanding when and why to use classes
1. [**Classes and Objects**](docs/01-classes-and-objects.md) - The foundation: what classes are and how to create objects
2. [**Properties and Constructors**](docs/02-properties-and-constructors.md) - Data storage and object initialization
3. [**Methods and `this`**](docs/03-methods-and-this.md) - Defining behavior and understanding context
4. [**Static Members**](docs/04-static-members.md) - Class-level properties and methods
5. [**Access Modifiers & Encapsulation**](docs/05-access-modifiers-encapsulation.md) - public, private, protected, and readonly
6. [**Getters and Setters**](docs/06-getters-setters.md) - Property accessors, validation, and computed properties
7. [**Inheritance**](docs/07-inheritance.md) - Extending classes, `super` keyword, and method overriding
8. [**Abstract Classes**](docs/08-abstract-classes.md) - Abstraction, abstract methods, and templates
9. [**Interfaces & Polymorphism**](docs/09-interfaces-polymorphism.md) - Contracts, multiple implementations, and polymorphism

**Quick Reference:**

- [**Keywords Reference**](docs/keywords-reference.md) - Complete reference for all OOP keywords (class, new, this, static, extends, super, etc.)

### Exercises (6 Challenges)

Progressive exercises that build on each concept:

- [Exercise 1: Basic Classes](exercises.md#exercise-1-basic-classes)
- [Exercise 2: Access Modifiers](exercises.md#exercise-2-access-modifiers)
- [Exercise 3: Getters and Setters](exercises.md#exercise-3-getters-and-setters)
- [Exercise 4: Inheritance](exercises.md#exercise-4-inheritance)
- [Exercise 5: Abstract Classes](exercises.md#exercise-5-abstract-classes)
- [Exercise 6: Interfaces and Polymorphism](exercises.md#exercise-6-interfaces-and-polymorphism)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v4 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd typescript-oop-guide
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### For Learners

1. **Read the notes** in order (00-09):
   - Start with [`docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md`](docs/00-real-world-use-cases.md)
   - Progress through each topic sequentially
   - Take your time to understand each concept
   - Use the [Keywords Reference](docs/keywords-reference.md) for quick lookups

2. **Complete the exercises** from [`exercises.md`](exercises.md):
   - Create `.ts` files in the `src/` folder for each exercise (e.g., `src/exercise1.ts`, `src/exercise2.ts`)
   - Complete one exercise at a time
   - Run your solutions with: `npx ts-node src/exercise1.ts` (exercise1 used as example here)
   - Commit your solutions to your forked repository to track your progress

3. **Practice and experiment**:
   - Modify the examples from the notes
   - Try creating your own classes
   - Combine concepts in creative ways

### Working with Exercises

**Creating exercise files:**

Create `.ts` files in the `src/` folder (either via CLI or your IDE):

```bash
# Via command line
touch src/exercise1.ts

# Or just create the file manually in your code editor
```

**Running exercise files:**

```bash
# Run any exercise file directly with ts-node
npx ts-node src/exercise1.ts
npx ts-node src/exercise2.ts
# ... and so on
```

**Saving your work:**

- Commit your exercise solutions in your **forked repository** to track your learning progress
- Your solutions are personal - don't create PRs to submit exercise solutions
- Focus on learning at your own pace!

## 📋 Learning Path

The documentation is structured to build progressively:

```
Basics (Understanding the Foundation)
├── 00: Why use classes?
├── 01: What are classes and objects?
├── 02: How to store data (properties & constructors)
└── 03: How to define behavior (methods & this)
    ↓
Class-Level Features
├── 04: Static members (class-level vs instance-level)
└── 05: Access control (public, private, protected, readonly)
    ↓
Advanced Property Access
└── 06: Getters and setters (controlled access patterns)
    ↓
Advanced Concepts (Code Reuse and Abstraction)
├── 07: Inheritance (code reuse through extension)
├── 08: Abstract classes (templates for subclasses)
└── 09: Interfaces & polymorphism (contracts and flexibility)
```
